# Warren Buffett's Meeting with University of Maryland MBA Students  
**November 15, 2013**

*Notes taken by Professor David Kass, Department of Finance, Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland and Rahul Shah, MBA student*

## Meeting Overview

Warren Buffett (WB) met with 20 MBA students from each of eight universities, including the University of Maryland, on November 15, 2013. The MBA students asked 16 questions in the following order:

---

## Q&A Session

### (1) Has Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) lowered its hurdle rate as it grew larger?

**WB:** BRK does not have a hurdle rate. The added capital makes it harder to achieve superior returns. If I manage $1 million I will get better returns than managing $210 billion (BRK's net worth). **Size is the enemy of performance.** I would still rather manage $210 billion than $1 million.

### (2) In the past you said you attribute 85% of your investing to Benjamin Graham and 15% to Philip Fisher. Has that percentage changed?

**WB:** I developed my investment strategy under Graham. I went to Columbia and learned from Graham. With Graham's approach, you cannot lose money over time. It's very quantitative in nature, and you have to do reasonably well. On the other hand, it has less and less application as you get into bigger and bigger companies with larger sums of money. 

> **It's better to buy wonderful businesses at fair prices than so-so businesses at low prices.**

With the "cigar approach", you can find a nasty cigar on the ground, with one puff left, can pick it up, light it and you get a free puff. You can keep doing this and get many free puffs. That's one approach, that's what I did. I looked for very cheap stocks quantitatively. After exposure to Fisher and Charlie, I started looking for better companies. Previously I was doing both. Now we are looking for good companies, not just cheap companies.

**Key Examples:**
- **Western Insurance (1951):** Earning $29.09/share, previous year $21.66, price traded 3-13, bought at 16 (<1x earnings)
- **Korean Stocks (2004):** Found 20 companies selling at 2x earnings through Citigroup book
- **Burlington Northern:** Now earning $6 billion pre-tax vs $3 billion before purchase

**Charlie told me – "You're never going to disagree with me because you're smart and I'm always right".**

### (3) What is the process you follow in writing the annual shareholders letter?

**WB:** I finished the 2013 letter already, but I will send it out on Feb 28. I already know what I'm going to say, just have to fill in some numbers and send it off.

**My approach:**
- Think of shareholders as partners
- Ask: "What would I want to know if they were running the place?"
- First draft addresses my sisters who don't know finance ("Dear sisters")
- Include one general teaching lesson (2013: 2,600 words out of 11,500 on investing)

**Ground Rules Philosophy:**
In 1956 I bought a ledger for $0.49, explained ground rules in half a page:
- This is what I can do
- This is what I can't do  
- This is how I intend to go about it
- This is how I measure my success

"If this looks good to you, then buy in. If you don't want to buy in, then don't – we can still be friends."

### (4) Why did you convert Goldman Sachs warrants into a smaller stake in the company?

**WB:** Goldman Sachs and GE, we helped finance them in 2008 which I never dreamt would happen. BRK received warrants with preferred stocks, expiring in 5 years (Sept 2013).

**Settlement Details:**
- **Goldman Sachs:** Warrants for $5 billion → BRK ended with $2 billion in shares without cash outlay
- **GE:** Warrants for $3 billion → BRK ended with $200 million in shares
- **Bank of America:** Only remaining major warrant - 700 million shares at $7.14 ($5 billion) through August 2021

**The 2008 Crisis:**
- Money market failed because of Lehman
- $175 billion flowed out in first three days after Lehman failed
- American industry literally stopped
- **George Bush:** "If money doesn't loosen up, this sucker will go down" – greatest economic statement of all time

**BRK's Cash Philosophy:**
> "Cash at that time is like oxygen. When you don't need it, you don't notice it. When you do need it, it's the only thing you need."

**Investment Wisdom:** "Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy."

### (5) How has your understanding of markets contributed towards your political views?

**WB:** I call this the **"Ovarian Lottery"**.

Imagine you're born 24 hours from now, and a genie says you'll determine the political, economic and social system, but first you must draw from 7 billion slips – you could be born intelligent or not, healthy or disabled, black or white, in US or Bangladesh.

**Not knowing which slip you'll get, how would you design the world?**

You want:
- A system that gets what people want
- More and more output (more wealth to share)
- No one left behind 
- Incentivize top performers but don't want equality in results
- Those who get bad tickets still have a decent life
- No fear of lack of money in old age, fear of healthcare costs

### (6) You are one of the few male CEOs who champions women in the workplace. Can you talk about your reasoning?

**WB:** We wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1776 – "All men are created equal". In 1789 we wrote a Constitution – on second thoughts… blacks are only 3/5 of a person.

**Timeline of Equality:**
- **1776:** "All men are created equal"
- **1789:** Constitution (blacks = 3/5 person)
- **1863:** Gettysburg Address (Lincoln repeats "all men")
- **1920:** Women get right to vote (131 years later)

**My Philosophy:** "I think its nuts for a CEO to pass up the most talented person based on their gender. But we are going in the right direction."

---

### (7) How do you assess management when acquiring a company?

**WB:** I handed Mrs. B (Nebraska Furniture Mart) a big check, and none of them had to work anymore. But will they behave the same after they get the money?

**Key Questions:**
- Will they work just as hard when putting money in their own pocket?
- 3/4 of our managers are independently wealthy
- They don't need me, I need them

**Why I Work:**
1. **I get to paint my own painting** – Berkshire Hathaway is my painting
2. **I want applause** – I like it when people appreciate my painting

"It's a good culture when managers really care about the business."

### (8) Now information is everywhere. If you were born in Peru today, could you have thrived in the same manner?

**WB:** Yes, I do. Things are changing around the world. People are able to move within and up through socio-economic classes. America didn't work harder when increasing GDP more than other countries, we allowed for equal opportunity.

---

### (9) What career path would you advise someone who wants to go into investing today?

**WB:** You just want to learn everything about it. There's so much to learn. Learning what works and what doesn't work, where value resides and where value doesn't reside.

**My Early Experience:**
- **1942 (age 11):** Bought 3 shares of Cities Service Preferred at $38.25
- Sold at $42 after sister complained daily
- Two years later: Shares worth $200

**Current Philosophy:** "I like running businesses better than investing. It is more fun building businesses than moving money around."

**Todd Combs and Ted Weschler** each manage $6.5 billion, earning less than they would at hedge funds, but they like being at Berkshire.

---

### (10) Question seeking advice for women

**WB:** I recommend reading **Personal History by Katherine Graham**. Presidents came to see her. She overcame the handicap that her mother and husband told her she was nothing.

---

### (11) You were the first person to use the term "moats" as competitive advantage. What do you think about Morningstar's work on moats?

**WB:** I think they're doing a great job. I came up with this term 40+ years ago because in capitalism, you have these economic castles.

**Moat Components:**
1. **A moat around the castle**
2. **A knight in the castle trying to widen the moat**

**Examples:**
- **Coca-Cola:** Deepened thought that Coke = happiness (moat is in your mind)
- **Railroads:** Barriers to entry
- **Geico:** Low prices
- **See's Candies:** Creates moat in consumers' minds (raised price every Dec 26 for 41 years)
- **Snickers:** #1 candy bar for 40 years

---

### (12) How do you balance work/family life and what advice do you have for a young professional?

**WB:** The most important decision you're going make is who you're going to marry. What's important is that what your thoughts are on big things, must make sure that your spouse has the same thoughts on the same big things.

**Key Advice:**
- Don't marry someone to change them
- Marry someone who is a better person than you are
- Always associate yourself with people who are better than you

---

### (13) Do you have a goal of beating the Dow Jones Industrials by 10 percentage points each year?

**WB:** Years ago, I was trying to beat the Dow (would be the S&P today). We don't have some number we expect to make. We do what we can that we think is the best at the time.

**Investment Philosophy:** 2,600 years ago: "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush." But you need to question:
- How sure are you that there are two in the bush?
- How far is the bush?  
- What is the interest rate?

**Performance Target:** If managing only $1 million, you should beat the S&P 500 by 10 percentage points with no risk or leverage.

---

### (14) What was the most difficult negotiation you were ever involved in?

**WB:** Only really learned negotiations from my dad. I don't want to be in a negotiation where it "has to end" at some point.

**My Style:**
- Just say what I do
- Stick to it throughout life
- Can walk away from anything
- Say I'll pay $X, and normally this is the best deal
- Don't want to lowball then counter

**Key Principle:** "You don't want to get in a negotiation that you can't afford to walk away from. Bargaining with people you love is a terrible mistake. The most powerful force in the world is unconditional love."

---

### (15) What has been your biggest investment mistake and how did you learn from it?

**WB:** It is better to learn from other peoples mistakes rather than your own.

**Major Mistakes:**
1. **Buying Berkshire Hathaway** – had all money in bad business for 20 years
2. **Dexter Shoe** – $400 million in BRK stock (now worth $5-6 billion) – went bankrupt
3. **Energy Future Holding bonds** – lost $2 billion (KKR lost $8 billion)

**Philosophy:** "You cannot play the game without making mistakes. I don't believe in beating yourself over it, you're going to make mistakes."

---

### (16) When managing other peoples money and making mistakes, how do you deal with the responsibility/burden?

**WB:** I tell them I'm going to make mistakes, but the goal is to do this and this and this.

**Risk Management:**
- Operate in a way where I can't lose significant sums over time
- Might not make the most money, but minimize risk of permanent loss
- **Rule:** If there's 1 in 1000 chance that an investment can threaten permanent loss to other people, I won't do it
