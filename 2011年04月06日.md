# Four Blue Chips Ripe for Spinoffs

**12:01 AM ET, April 6, 2011 (MarketWatch)**  
**NEW YORK (MarketWatch)** – Recently, there has been a spike in spinoff transactions.

Examples include Fortune Brands Inc. and its plans to spin off non-liquor-related business, Marathon Oil Corp.'s move to spin off its refining business and Motorola splitting into Motorola Solutions Inc. and Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. to separate its smartphone business from other operations.

No doubt, the results can be nice for investors. Just look at ITT Corp. In early January, it announced that it would spin off its water and military technology businesses. And Wall Street loved it.

On the announcement, ITT's stock spiked 16.5%. The belief was that the company would have more focus and improve its competitiveness. Besides, ITT shareholders would not have to worry about declining military spending. Ultimately, profits should increase.

So what are some other companies that are ripe for spinoffs? Here's a look:

## Pfizer Inc.

Since reaching $14 last July, Pfizer's stock has had a nice run. It's now trading at $20. Unfortunately, it's still well below the price at which it traded in 2000 – about $45. The fact is that Pfizer has been living off several blockbuster drugs that will soon come off their patents. At the same time, its pipeline of new drugs has been meager.

But Pfizer has a new chief executive, Ian Read, who wants to shake things up. For example, this week, the company said it will sell its Capsugel business to KKR for $2.38 billion.

Yet this should be only the start. Pfizer has several other substantial businesses like animal health, generic pharmaceuticals and nutritionals.

Pfizer has certainly noted the spinoff strategy's success at rival Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., which issued shares in Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. in early February 2009. Since then, Mead Johnson's stock has gone from $26.81 to $58.33 and its price-to-earnings ratio stands at 27. Consider that Bristol-Myers's multiple is only 14.

Applying the same valuation multiple to Pfizer's nutritionals unit, a spinoff would result in a valuation of about $7 billion.

## Symantec Corp.

Back in late 2004, Symantec's stock was trading at about $32, and its core security-software business was strong. But to push growth, the company spent $13 billion on Veritas Software, which was a major storage provider. The strategic rationale was that there would eventually be lots of synergies between security and storage.

However, the merger turned out to be a dud. Symantec's stock price is now at about $18.46.

Yet security and storage remain solid businesses with promising long-term futures. Over the past few years, Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM and Dell Inc. have paid hefty premiums for these types of companies.

For Symantec, a good way to realize this value is to spin off its storage business. Top companies in the sector include Netapp Inc. and EMC Corp., which trade at cash flow multiples of about 15.

Assuming Symantec's storage business can trade at the same levels, it would be about $15 billion. That's roughly the parent company's current market cap.

## Yahoo Inc.

In 2008, Microsoft Corp. offered $33 a share to buy Yahoo, but that wasn't enough to reach a deal. Well, now Yahoo's shares are trading at about $16.84.

Yahoo has continued to suffer, though. It has failed to deal with the growing threat of Facebook and Google Inc. There have also been layoffs, which have caused low morale.

But Yahoo still has some juicy assets, such as a 35% stake in its Japan business and 40% of Alibaba, a top e-commerce operator in China. Based on the market values of these assets, a sale could result in cash of $14 to $15 a share.

True, a transaction will not be easy because of shareholder agreements and taxes. But with so much at stake, there should be lots of incentive to get a deal done.

## General Electric Co.

General Electric understands the importance of spinoffs. For example, it structured a deal to transfer a 51% controlling stake in the NBC Universal division to Comcast Corp.

For a company like GE, it is important to have a highly optimized portfolio of companies, which have scale and large cash flows. But to grow, the company is now focused on the global market for energy infrastructure.

So it probably makes sense to spin off other businesses. And perhaps the most obvious is GE Capital. The business suffered greatly during the financial crisis of 2008, but it has since recovered nicely.

The valuation? Well, assuming it is about 1 times book value, it would be about $68 billion.

### 评论区精选

**Q:** 段先生，现在如果让你二选一，你会选雅虎还是苹果？你会有这方面的困惑么？  
**A:** 段永平：目前这个价格我倾向苹果。

**Q:** 想了解下段总关于买苹果的思路...主要是学习为主，没有跟风的意思。  
**A:** 段永平：因为我认为苹果依然是低pe同时高增长的公司。差别在有多少人会认为苹果还会在相当长的时间增长呢？显然巴菲特不会这么认为，就像我老是觉得人们就快要不喝可乐一样（但可口可乐的营销是绝对强的，几乎任何地方都能找到可口可乐）

**Q:** 低pe同时高增长的公司是彼得林奇的最爱...为什么段大哥会倾向苹果呢？这个我还没想明白  
**A:** 段永平：看得更明白。

**Q:** 是啊，我是憋了很久没敢说，我每次喝可乐之后总觉得牙齿都变软掉，骨头都不敢啃，为什么还卖得这么好呢？  
**A:** 段永平：你该看牙医了，胃可能也要看了。可能是憋的。

**Q:** 在中国，娃哈哈与双汇的网络比可乐做的好...  
**A:** 段永平：如果农村市场大到一定程度可能就不一样了，还有就是你是用多少年来看的。双汇的网络现在还很好吗？宗庆后很强，他绝对可以在农村市场对抗可口可乐很多年，但"很多年"以后呢？

**Q:** 个人认为雅虎的downside risk估计很低，所以雅虎比较安全...  
**A:** 段永平：难道你曾经希望雅虎有啥东西会显著上升的？

**Q:** 的确是，我自己期望有点过高...  
**A:** 段永平：一看到雅虎说要开始加大并购了我就有点汗。美国雅虎的现金流还是非常不错的，但市场地位在未来会不断下降。目前雅虎的价钱里基本上就没有考虑美国雅虎的价值，这多少有点不公平但也未必一点没道理。如果雅虎未来几年为了自己"东山再起"的雄心而进行大规模的收购的话，那美国雅虎就真没什么价值了。不过，到目前为止雅虎看起来还是很理性的。

**Q:** 恩，你对雅虎目前的看法也很理性...  
**A:** 段永平：雅虎企业文化弱，买公司很难有好结局。

**Q:** 段老师，我不认同雅虎像烟蒂型的股票...  
**A:** 段永平：你能说点别人不知道的东西啵？

**Q:** 段总，最近没见您点评A股，华侨城会是高增长的公司么？  
**A:** 段永平：我什么时候点评过A股？华侨城怎么可能是高增长的公司呢？这个价能低增长就满意了。只要别负增长就行。
