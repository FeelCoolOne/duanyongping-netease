# 功夫熊猫经典语录

> One meets its destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.  
> **往往在逃避命运的路上，却与之不期而遇**

---

> Your mind is like this water, my friend, when it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see, but if you allow it to settle, the answer becomes clear.  
> **你的思想就如同水，我的朋友，当水波摇曳时，很难看清，不过当它平静下来，答案就清澈见底了。**

---

> Quit don't quit. Noodles don't noodles.  
> **退出，不退出。做面条，不做面条。**

---

> Yesterday is history  
> Tomorrow is a mystery  
> But today is a gift  
> That is why it's called the present (the gift)  
> **昨天是历史，明天是谜团，只有今天是天赐的礼物**

---

> There are no accidents  
> **从来没有什么意外**

---

> But there are things we can control. I can control when the fruit will fall… And I can control what time to seed.  
> **不过有些事情我们可以控制，我可以控制果实何时坠落，我还可以控制在何处播种。**

---

> Yes, but no matter what you do, that seed will grow to be a peach tree. You may wish for an Apple or an orange, but you will get a peach.  
> **是啊，不过无论你做了什么，那个种子还是会长成桃树，你可能想要苹果或桔子，可你只能得到桃子，那个种子还是会长成桃树。**

---

> Maybe it can if you are willing to guide it, to nuture it, to believe in it.

---

> You cannot leave, real warrior never quits.  
> **你不能走，真的武士决不会退却**

---

> Why didn't you quit? you know I was trying to get rid of you, but you stayed.  
> **那你为什么不退出呢？你知道我一直想把你赶走，可你还是留下来了。**

---

> Yes, I stayed. I stayed, because every time you threw up brick on the head or said I smelled, it hurts. But it could never hurt more than I did everyday in my life just being me. I stayed, because I thought.. If anyone could change me, could make me not me, it was you the greatest Kong Fu teacher in the whole of China!  
> **是啊，我留下来了。我留下来是因为每次你往我头上丢砖头，或说我难闻，这很伤我的心。可最伤我心的是，我每天努力练习，却还是这个我。我留下来，因为我以为，如果还有人能改变我，能让我焕然一新，那就是你——中国最伟大的功夫师父！**

---

> I'm sorry things didn't work out… It's just what it's meant to be. Paul, forget everything else, your destiny still awaits.  
> **阿宝，天不遂人愿，况且这本不是天意，阿宝，忘了其它的事情，你的使命一直都在向你召唤。**

---

> We are Noodle folk, Broth runs deep through our veins.  
> **我们是面条家族，血管中流着面汤。**

---

> The secret ingredient of my secret ingredient soup is… nothing. To make something special, you just have to believe it's special.  
> **我私家汤的绝密食材，就是……什么都没有。认为它特别，它就特别了。**
