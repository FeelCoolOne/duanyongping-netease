I enjoyed this little story, and thought it was quite thought provoking. Fit for the beginning of a new year.

Happy New Year to you and yours! May the New Year bring you all good health, peace and true happiness!

## The Violinist in the Metro

**Location:** Washington DC Metro Station  
**Time:** Cold January morning in 2007  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  

A man with a violin played six Bach pieces for about 45 minutes. During that time, approximately 2,000 people went through the station, most of them on their way to work.

### The Timeline

**🕒 3 minutes:** A middle-aged man noticed the musician, slowed his pace, stopped for a few seconds, then hurried on to meet his schedule.

**🕒 4 minutes:** The violinist received his first dollar. A woman threw money in the hat and, without stopping, continued to walk.

**🕒 6 minutes:** A young man leaned against the wall to listen, then looked at his watch and started to walk again.

**🕒 10 minutes:** A 3-year-old boy stopped, but his mother tugged him along hurriedly. The kid stopped to look at the violinist again, but the mother pushed hard and the child continued to walk, turning his head the whole time. This action was repeated by several other children, but every parent — without exception — forced their children to move on quickly.

**🕒 45 minutes:** The musician played continuously. Only 6 people stopped and listened for a short while. About 20 gave money but continued to walk at their normal pace. The man collected a total of $32.

**🕒 1 hour:** He finished playing and silence took over. No one noticed and no one applauded. There was no recognition at all.

## The Revelation

No one knew this, but the violinist was **Joshua Bell**, one of the greatest musicians in the world. He played one of the most intricate pieces ever written, with a violin worth $3.5 million dollars.

Two days before, Joshua Bell sold out a theater in Boston where the seats averaged $100 each to sit and listen to him play the same music.

This is a true story. Joshua Bell, playing incognito in the D.C. Metro Station, was organized by the Washington Post as part of a social experiment about perception, taste and people's priorities.

---

## The Questions

This experiment raised several questions:

- In a common-place environment, at an inappropriate hour, do we perceive beauty?
- If so, do we stop to appreciate it?
- Do we recognize talent in an unexpected context?

---

## The Lesson

One possible conclusion reached from this experiment could be this:

> If we do not have a moment to stop and listen to one of the best musicians in the world, playing some of the finest music ever written, with one of the most beautiful instruments ever made... **How many other things are we missing as we rush through life?**

> Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery, Today is a gift. That's why it's called: **The Present**.

> Enjoy life NOW… it has an expiration date.

## 💭 Reflections & Discussion

**段永平的思考：**

> 郁郁不得志的人往往都是有他们自己的问题的。只是他们自己经常不愿意面对或真的不知道而已。从长期而言，社会还是比较有效率的，就像股票市场一样。但就个体而言，还是要明白酒香也怕巷子深的道理。

> 其实这个故事告诉大家的也许是另一个故事：一个"伟大的音乐家"和一个"不错的街头小提琴手"的细微差别——只有在舞台上时才能看出来（那时的感觉可能是巨大的）。

> 卓越的企业和优秀的企业的差别难道不也是如此吗？好的价值投资者和泛泛而谈之人的差别好像也是如此啊。
