The British photojournalist Tim Hetherington, whose documentary on the Afghan war, *Restrepo*, was nominated for an Oscar, was killed in Libya yesterday while covering fighting in the besieged opposition-held city of Misrata.

Mr Hetherington, 41, is the first Western journalist to lose his life while covering the Libyan civil war. Three other journalists with him were injured, including photographers Chris Hondros and Guy Martin who were seriously hurt.

Mr Hondros, an American working for the Getty photo agency, suffered a severe brain injury and was in a critical condition, according to a colleague who was with them when they were treated. Mr Martin, a British citizen working for the Panos photo agency, had suffered shrapnel wounds and was undergoing surgery.
