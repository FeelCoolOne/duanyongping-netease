# **Acquisition Criteria & Success Factors**

## **Core Philosophy**
- **No employment contracts** – We don't believe in them
- **No micromanagement** – We don't stand over people with whips
- **Preserve passion** – Our goal is not to kill or dampen their love for their business
- **Already successful** – Most candidates are already rich

## **The Three Essential Qualities**
1. **Intelligence**
2. **Energy** 
3. **Integrity**

> "If you don't have the latter, then you should hope they don't have the first two either. If someone doesn't have integrity, then you want them to be dumb and lazy." *(Laughter)*

## **The Crucial Question**
"Do they love the business or the money?"

**Red Flag:** Someone wanting to cash out creates problems because:
- Berkshire only has 16 people at headquarters
- We can't run businesses ourselves

## **Why Our Strategy Works**

### **Unique Approach**
- **Minimal oversight model** – The opposite of traditional conglomerates
- **Preserved incentives** – We maintain the passion that made them successful
- **Decentralized structure** – No Executive Vice Presidents, HR departments, or directives from headquarters

### **Industry Contrast**
- **Gillette, oil companies** – Buy businesses and try to run them themselves
- **GE model** – Works, but very different from ours
- **Our approach** – Count on already-wealthy founders to make us rich

## **Succession Planning**
- **Internal candidate** – Successor will come from Berkshire
- **System knowledge** – Knows our model and has seen it work
- **Cultural continuity** – Surrounded by people who believe in the system
- **Momentum** – Keep the train going at 90 miles per hour

## **The Paradox**
> "The interesting thing is how well it has worked over a great many decades, and how few people copy it." *(Laughter)*

## **Key Success Factors**

### **Simplicity Itself**
- Let people who play the game very well **keep doing it**
- Successor won't change this approach
- **Biggest risk** – Cultural tampering and oversteering
- **Protection** – Board and owners won't allow cultural changes

### **The Oversight Principle**
> "Our success has come from the lack of oversight we've provided, and our success will continue to be from a lack of oversight."

**Trade-off:** Minimal oversight requires **careful acquisition decisions**.
